well the theme is absolute garbage

Theme 1: a nuclear submarine resource mngmt. nightmare
- run around a submarine trying to fix as many system
  as possible
- endless gameplay (idk, i don't like it)

Theme 2: unstable magic
- each spell has pros/cons
- kinda terrible idea

Theme 3: Unstable VR world
- pretty cool
- have to perform specific tasks each day
- "game" is bugged to shit

FINAL THEME: 3
